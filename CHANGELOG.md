- Adds the [`Braze.subscribeToSessionUpdates(_:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/subscribetosessionupdates(_:)) method and [`Braze.sessionUpdatesStream`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/sessionupdatesstream) property to subscribe to the session updates events generated by the SDK.
- Adds public APIs to access `BrazeKit`, `BrazeLocation` and `BrazeUI` resources bundles:
  - `Braze.Resources.bundle`
  - `BrazeLocationResources.bundle`
  - `BrazeUIResources.bundle`
- `BrazeKit.overrideResourceBundle` and `BrazeUI.overrideResourceBundle` have been deprecated in favor of `BrazeKit.overrideResourcesBundle` and `BrazeUI.overrideResourcesBundle`.

  - [Braze.WebViewBridge.ScriptMessageHandler.init(logClick:logError:showNewsFeed:closeMessage:braze:)](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/webviewbridge/scriptmessagehandler/init(logclick:logerror:shownewsfeed:closemessage:braze:)-p2ki) is now defined.
  - [BrazeDelegate.braze(_:willPresentModalWithContext:)](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/brazedelegate/braze(_:willpresentmodalwithcontext:)-1fj41) now have a default implementation.
  - Handling network requests and persisting data properly extend the lifetime of the application for processing.

## 8.0.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes the reported SDK version, see [8.0.0](#800).
- Removes crash data from the `BrazeKit` privacy manifest. This data type is not collected by Braze.

## 8.0.0

##### ⚠️ Warning
- This release reports the SDK version as `7.7.0` instead of `8.0.0`.

##### Breaking
- Compiles the SDK using Xcode version 15.2 (15C500b).
  - This also raises the minimum deployment targets to iOS 12.0 and tvOS 12.0.
- The `BrazeLocation` class is now marked as unavailable. It was previously deprecated in favor of `BrazeLocationProvider` in 5.8.1.

##### Added
- Adds support for visionOS 1.0.
  - ⚠️ Rich push notifications and Push Stories may not display as expected on visionOS 1.0. We are monitoring the latest versions for potential fixes.
  - ⚠️ CocoaPods is not yet supported by SDWebImage for visionOS. visionOS sample apps requiring SDWebImage have been disabled in the `Examples-CocoaPods.xcworkspace`. Refer to the SwiftPM or manual integration Xcode project instead.

## 7.7.0

##### Added
- Updates the prebuilt release assets to include the privacy manifest for manual integrations of SDWebImage.
  - Follow the [manual integration guide](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/initial_sdk_setup/installation_methods/manual_integration/?tab=static) to add the `SDWebImage.bundle` to your project for static XCFrameworks.
- Enhances support for language localizations.
  - Introduces a localization for Azerbaijani strings.
  - Updates Ukrainian localization strings for accuracy.

##### Fixed
- Fixes the default button placement for full in-app message views.

  - If the SDK is given an invalid endpoint, it will no longer attempt to make network requests and will instead log an error.
- Fixes an issue preventing `BrazeLocation` from working correctly when using the dynamic XCFrameworks.

## 7.6.0

##### Added
- Adds the `Braze.InAppMessage.Data.isTestSend` property, which indicates whether an in-app message was triggered as part of a test send.
- Adds logic to separate Braze data into tracking and non-tracking requests.
  - Adds the following methods to set and edit the allow list for properties that will be used for tracking:
    - `Braze.Configuration.Api.trackingPropertyAllowList`: Set the initial allow list before initializing Braze.
    - `Braze.updateTrackingAllowList(adding:removing:)`: Update the existing allow list during runtime.
  - For full usage details on these configurations, refer to our tutorial [here](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/e1-privacy-tracking/).

##### Fixed
- Adds safeguards to prevent a rare race condition occuring in the SDK network layer.
- Prevents in-app message test sends from attempting re-display after being discarded by a custom in-app message UI delegate.
- Fixes an issue in the default Braze in-app message UI where some messages were not being removed from the stack after display.
- Fixes the compilation of `BrazeKitCompat` and `BrazeUICompat` in Objective-C++ projects.

- Fixes the encoding of values of types `Float`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `UInt`, `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32` and `UInt64`. Those types were previously not supported in custom events and purchase properties.
- Fixes an issue preventing purchase events from being logged when the product identifier has a leading dollar sign.
- Fixes an issue preventing custom attributes from being logged when the attribute key has a leading dollar sign.

## 7.5.0

##### Added
- Adds privacy manifests for `BrazeKit` and `BrazeLocation` to describe Braze's data collection policies. For more details, refer to [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests) on privacy manifests.
  - More fine-tuned configurations to manage your data collection practices will be made available in a future release.
- Adds the `optInWhenPushAuthorized` configuration property to specify whether a user's notification subscription state should automatically be set to `optedIn` when updating push permissions to authorized.
- The WebKit Inspector developer tool is now enabled by default for all instances of `BrazeInAppMessagesUI.HtmlView`. It can be disabled by setting `BrazeInAppMessagesUI.HtmlView.Attributes.allowInspector` to `false`.

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue with the code signatures of XCFrameworks introduced in `7.1.0`.
- Fixes a crash on tvOS devices running versions below 16.0, caused by the absence of the `UIApplication.openNotificationSettingsURLString` symbol in those OS versions.
- Fixes an issue where a content card would not display if the value under "Redirect to Web URL" was an empty string.
- Fixes incorrect behavior in BrazeUI where tapping the body of a `Full` or `Modal` in-app message with buttons and an "Image Only" layout would dismiss that message and process the button's click action.
  - Tapping the body will now be a no-op, bringing parity with other platforms.

## 7.4.0

##### Added
- Adds two alternative repositories to support specialized integration options. For instructions on how to leverage them, refer to their respective READMEs:
  - [braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt-static](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt-static) which provides all Braze modules as static XCFrameworks.
  - [braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt-dynamic](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt-dynamic) which provides all Braze modules as dynamic XCFrameworks.
- In-App Message assets from URLs containing the query parameter `cache=false` will not be prefetched.
  - Additionally, when presented as a part of In-App Messages or Content Cards, those URLs will be fetched using the [`URLRequest.CachePolicy.reloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlrequest/cachepolicy/reloadignoringlocalandremotecachedata) caching policy, which always requests a fresh version from the source and ignores any cached versions.

##### Fixed
- Fixes XCFrameworks headers to use the `#import` syntax instead of `@import` for compatibility with Objective-C++ contexts.
- Fixes the push token tag validation during Live Activity registration, accepting strings up to 256 bytes instead of 255 bytes.
- `Braze.ContentCards.unviewedCards` no longer includes Control cards to bring parity with Android and Web.
- Fixes an Objective-C metaclass crash that occurs when initializing a custom subclass of certain BrazeUI views.

## 7.3.0

##### Added
- Adds support for Expo Notifications [event listeners](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#notification-events-listeners) when using the automatic push integration.

##### Fixed
- Fixes a rare concurrency issue that might result in duplicated events when logging large amount of events.
- Fixes an issue where `user.set(dateOfBirth:)` was not setting the date of birth accurately due to variations in the device's timezone.

## 7.2.0

##### Added
- Exposes the `BrazePushStory.NotificationViewController.didReceive` methods for custom handling of push story notification events.

##### Fixed
- Resolves an issue for in-app messages with buttons where tapping on the body would incorrectly execute the button's click action.
  - Now, when you tap on the body of an in-app message with buttons, no event should occur.
- Resolves a potential deadlock under rare circumstances in BrazeUI's In-App messages presentation.
- Fixes the default implementation for the Objective-C representation of [`BrazeInAppMessageUIDelegate.inAppMessage(_:shouldProcess:url:buttonId:message:view:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazeui/brazeinappmessageuidelegate/inappmessage(_:shouldprocess:buttonid:message:view:)-7lvld) to return the proper click action URL.
- Resolves an issue where the body of the modal in-app message may be displayed stretched on some device models.
- Resolves an issue where `BrazeInAppMessageUI` could fail to detect the correct application window for presenting its post-click webview.
  - `BrazeInAppMessageUI` now prefers using the current key `UIWindow` instead of the first one in the application's window stack.

##### Removed
- `Braze.Configuration.DeviceProperty.pushDisplayOptions` has been deprecated. Providing this value no longer has an effect.

## 7.1.0

##### Fixed
- Resolves an issue preventing templated in-app messages from triggering if a previous attempt to display the message failed within the same session.
- Fixes an issue that prevented custom events and nested custom attributes from logging if had a property with a value that was prefixed with a `$`.
- Fixes a bug in the Content Cards feed UI where the empty feed message would not display when the user only had control cards in their feed.
- Adds additional safeguards when reading the device model.

##### Added
- Adds a code signature to all XCFrameworks in the Braze Swift SDK, signed by `Braze, Inc.`.
- `BrazeInAppMessageUI.DisplayChoice.later` has been deprecated in favor of `BrazeInAppMessageUI.DisplayChoice.reenqueue`.

## 7.0.0

##### Breaking
- The `useUUIDAsDeviceId` configuration is now enabled by default.
  - For more details on the impacts, refer to this [Collecting IDFV - Swift](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/analytics/swift_idfv/).
- The `Banner` Content Card type and corresponding UI elements have been renamed to `ImageOnly`. All member methods and properties remain the same.
  - `Braze.ContentCard.Banner` → `Braze.ContentCard.ImageOnly`
  - `BrazeContentCardUI.BannerCell` → `BrazeContentCardUI.ImageOnlyCell`
- Refactors some text layout logic in BrazeUI into a new `Braze.ModalTextView` class.
- Updates the behavior for Feature Flags methods.
  - `FeatureFlags.featureFlag(id:)` now returns `nil` for an ID that does not exist.
  - `FeatureFlags.subscribeToUpdates(:)` will trigger the callback when any refresh request completes with a success or failure.
    - The callback will also trigger immediately upon initial subscription if previously cached data exists from the current session.

##### Fixed
- Fixes compiler warnings about Swift 6 when compiling `BrazeUI` while using Xcode 15.
- Exposes public imports for `ABKClassicImageContentCardCell.h` and `ABKControlTableViewCell.h` for use in the BrazeUICompat layer.
- Adds additional safeguards around invalid constraint values for `BrazeInAppMessageUI.SlideupView`.
- Resolves a Content Cards feed UI issue displaying a placeholder image in Classic cards without an attached image.

##### Added
- Adds the `enableDarkTheme` property to `BrazeContentCardUI.ViewController.Attributes`.
  - Set this field to `false` to prevent the Content Cards feed UI from adopting dark theme styling when the device is in dark mode.
  - This field is `true` by default.

## 6.6.2

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing purchase events from being logged when the product identifier has a leading dollar sign ($).
- Fixes an issue preventing custom attributes from being logged when the attribute key has a leading dollar sign ($).

## 6.6.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes a crash in the geofences feature that could occur when the number of monitored regions exceeded the maximum count.
- Fixes an issue introduced in `6.3.1` that would always update a user's push subscription status to `optedIn` on app launch if push permissions were authorized on the device settings.
  - The SDK now will only send the subscription status at app launch if the device notification settings goes from denied to authorized.
- `Braze.ContentCard.logClick(using braze: Braze)` will now log a click regardless of whether the `ContentCard` has a `ClickAction`.
  - This behavior differs from the default API `Braze.ContentCard.Context.logClick()`, which has the safeguard of requiring a `ClickAction` to log a click.

## 6.6.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue in HTML in-app messages where custom event and purchase properties would always convert values for `1` and `0` to become `true` and `false`, respectively.
  - These property values will now respect their original form in the HTML.
- Prevents the default Braze UI from displaying in-app messages underneath the keyboard when Stage Manager is in use.

##### Added
- Adds the [`Braze.FeatureFlags.logFeatureFlagImpression(id: String)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/featureflags-swift.class/logfeatureflagimpression(id:)) method.
- Adds the optional `merge` parameter to the Objective-C representation of the [`setCustomAttribute(key:dictionary:merge:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/user-swift.class/setcustomattribute(key:dictionary:merge:fileid:line:)) method.

## 6.5.0

##### Fixed
- Content card impressions can now be logged any number of times on a single card, bringing parity with Android and Web.
  - This removes the limit introduced in 6.3.1 where a card impression could only be logged once per session.
  - In the Braze-provided Content Cards feed UI, impressions will be logged once per feed instance.

##### Added
- Adds a simplified method for integrating push notification support into your application:
  - Automatic push integration can be enabled by setting `configuration.push.automation = true` on your configuration object.
    - This eliminates the need for the manual push integration outlined in the [_Implement the push notification handlers manually_](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/b1-standard-push-notifications#Option-2-Implement-the-push-notification-handlers-manually) tutorial section.
    - When enabled, the SDK will automatically implement the necessary system delegate methods for handling push notifications.
    - Compatibility with other push providers, whether first or third party, is maintained. The SDK will automatically handle only Braze push notifications, while original system delegate methods will be executed for all other push notifications.
  - Each automation step can be independently enabled or disabled. For example, `configuration.push.automation.requestAuthorizationAtLaunch = false` can be used to prevent the automatic request for push permissions at launch.
  - Resources:
    - Updated [_Standard Push Notifications_](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/b1-standard-push-notifications) tutorial.
    - [`Braze.Configuration.Push.automation`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/configuration-swift.class/push-swift.class/automation-swift.property) property.
    - [`Braze.Configuration.Push.Automation`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/configuration-swift.class/push-swift.class/automation-swift.class) type (provides details about the behavior of each automation step).
- Adds the [`Braze.Configuration.forwardUniversalLinks`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/configuration-swift.class/forwarduniversallinks) configuration. When enabled, the SDK will redirect universal links from Braze campaigns to the appropriate system methods.
- Adds the [`Braze.Notifications.subscribeToUpdates(_:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/notifications-swift.class/subscribetoupdates(_:)) method to subscribe to the push notifications handled by the SDK.
  - This method runs the provided closure with a [`Braze.Notifications.Payload`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/notifications-swift.class/payload) class representing the processed push notification.
- Adds the [`Braze.Notifications.deviceToken`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/notifications-swift.class/devicetoken) property to access the most recent notification device token received by the SDK.

## 6.4.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing text fields from being selected in HTML IAMs for iOS 15.
- Fixes an issue where the device model was inaccurately reported as iPad on macOS (_Mac Catalyst_ and _Designed for iPad_ configurations).
- Fixes an issue where custom event and purchase properties would not accept an entry if its value was an empty string.
- Fixes a crash that occurred in the default UI for Content Cards when encountering a zero-value aspect ratio.
- Fixes an issue introduced in 6.0.0 where images in in-app messages would appear smaller than expected when using the compatibility UI (`BrazeUICompat`).

##### Added
- Adds the `unviewedCards` convenience property to the `Braze.ContentCards` class to get the unviewed content cards for the current user.

## 6.3.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where the previous user's data would not be flushed after calling `changeUser(userId:sdkAuthSignature:)` when the SDK authentication feature is enabled.
- A content card impression can now be logged once per session. Previously, the Braze-provided Content Cards UI would limit to a single impression per card at maximum, irrespective of sessions.
- Fixes an issue that previously caused push notification URLs with percent-encoded characters to fail during decoding.
- Fixes a behavior to automatically set a user's push subscription state to [`optedIn`][opted-in] after push permissions have explicitly been authorized via the Settings app.
- Correctly hides shadows on in-app messages that are configured with a transparent background.
- Fixes a rare crash occurring when deinitializing the Braze instance.

##### Added
- Adds additional logging for network-related decoding errors.

[opted-in]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/user-swift.class/subscriptionstate/optedin

## 6.3.0

##### Fixed
- "Confirm" and "Cancel" notification categories now show the correct titles on the action buttons.

##### Added
- Adds a new `SDKMetadata` option `.reactnativenewarch` for the React Native New Architecture.
- Adds public initializers for [`Braze.URLContext`][url-context] and [`Braze.ModalContext`][modal-context].

[url-context]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/urlcontext/
[modal-context]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/modalcontext/

## 6.2.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes a crash introduced in 6.0.0 when displaying an HTML in-app message using the `BrazeUICompat` module.
- Removed a system call that is known to be slow on older versions of macOS. This resolves the SDK hanging during initialization on Mac Catalyst when running on affected macOS versions.

##### Added
- Adds support for `target` attributes on anchor tags in HTML in-app messages (e.g. `<a href="..." target="_blank"></a>`).
  - Adding the `target` attribute to links will allow them to open in a new webview without dismissing the current in-app message.
  - This behavior can be disabled via the `linkTargetSupport` property of the `BrazeInAppMessageUI.HtmlView.Attributes` struct.
  - See our [Custom HTML in-app messages](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/traditional/customize/html_in-app_messages/) documentation page for more details.

## 6.1.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue that led to disproportionately large close buttons on in-app messages when the user has set a large font size in the device settings.
- Fixes an issue that would lock the screen in a specific orientation after the dismissal of an in-app message customized to be presented in that orientation.
  - This issue only impacted iOS 16.0+ devices.

##### Added
- Adds new versions of `setCustomAttribute` to the User object to support [nested custom attributes][nca-docs].
  - Renames `User.setCustomAttributeArray(key: String, array: [String]?)` to `setCustomAttribute(…)` to align it with other custom attribute setters, and adds "string" to the `addTo` and `removeFrom` attribute array methods to clarify which custom attributes they're used for.

[nca-docs]: https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/nested_custom_attribute_support

## 6.0.0

##### Breaking
- The in-app message data models sent to [`BrazeInAppMessagePresenter.present(message:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/brazeinappmessagepresenter/present(message:)) now contain remote asset URLs. Previously, these data models would contain local asset URLs.
  - This change is only breaking in two situations:
    - When implementing a custom `BrazeInAppMessagePresenter`.
    - When relying on asset URLs being local in the message provided by [`BrazeInAppMessageUIDelegate.inAppMessage(_:displayChoiceForMessage:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazeui/brazeinappmessageuidelegate/inappmessage(_:displaychoiceformessage:)-9w1nb)
  - The in-app message data models available from the other [`BrazeInAppMessageUIDelegate`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazeui/brazeinappmessageuidelegate) methods remain unchanged and contain local asset URLs.

##### Added
- The in-app message context now provides two additional methods:
  - [`getLocalAssets(urls:destinationURL:completionHandler:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/inappmessageraw/context-swift.class/getlocalassets(urls:destinationurl:completionhandler:)): Retrieves the local assets associated with the given remote asset URLs.
  - [`withLocalAssets(message:destinationURL:completionHandler:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/inappmessageraw/context-swift.class/withlocalassets(message:destinationurl:completionhandler:)): Returns a modified in-app message with all remote asset URLs replaced with local ones.

## 5.14.0

##### Fixed
- VoiceOver now correctly focuses on in-app message views when they are presented.
- Fixes an issue causing in-app messages with re-eligibility disabled to display multiple times under certain conditions.
- Fixes an issue where modal and full in-app message headers were truncated on devices running iOS versions lower than 16 when displaying non-ASCII characters.
- The dynamic variant of `BrazeUI.framework` in the release artifact `braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt.zip` is now an actual dynamic framework. Previously, this specific framework was mistakenly distributed as a static framework.

##### Added
- Adds the `BrazeSDKAuthDelegate` protocol as a separate protocol from `BrazeDelegate`, allowing for more flexible integrations.
  - Apps implementing `BrazeDelegate.braze(_:sdkAuthenticationFailedWithError:)` should migrate to use `BrazeSDKAuthDelegate` and remove the old implementation. The `BrazeDelegate` method will be removed in a future major release.

## 5.13.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where the SDK would automatically track body clicks on non-legacy HTML in-app messages.

##### Added
- Adds the synchronous `deviceId` property on the Braze instance.
  - `deviceId(queue:completion:)` is now deprecated.
  - `deviceId() async` is now deprecated.
- Adds the `automaticBodyClicks` property to the HTML in-app message view attributes. This property can be used to enable automatic body clicks tracking on non-legacy HTML in-app messages.
  - This property is `false` by default.
  - This property is ignored for legacy HTML in-app messages.

## 5.12.0

> Starting with this release, this SDK will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

##### Added
- Adds `json()` and `decoding(json:)` public methods to the Feature Flag model object for JSON encoding/decoding.

## 5.11.2

##### Fixed
- Fixes a crash occurring when the SDK is configured with a flush interval of `0` and network connectivity is poor.

## 5.11.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing the correct calculation of the delay when retrying failed requests. This led to a more aggressive retry schedule than intended.
- Improves the performance of Live Activity tracking by de-duping push token tag requests.
- Fixes an issue in `logClick(using:)` where it would incorrectly open the `url` field in addition to logging a click for metrics. It now only logs a click for metrics.
  - This applies to the associated APIs for content cards, in-app messages, and news feed cards.
  - It is still recommended to use the associated `Context` object to log interactions instead of these APIs.

##### Added
- Adds [`BrazeKit.overrideResourceBundle`] and [`BrazeUI.overrideResourceBundle`] to allow for custom resource bundles to be used by the SDK.
  - This feature is useful when your setup prevents you from using the default resource bundle (e.g. Tuist).

[`BrazeKit.overrideResourceBundle`]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/overrideresourcebundle
[`BrazeUI.overrideResourceBundle`]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazeui/overrideresourcebundle/

## 5.11.0

##### Added
- Adds support for [Live Activities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit/displaying-live-data-with-live-activities) via the `liveActivities` module on the Braze instance.
  - This feature provides the following new methods for tracking and managing Live Activities with the Braze push server:
    - `launchActivity(pushTokenTag:activity:)`
    - `resumeActivities(ofType:)`
  - This feature requires iOS 16.1 and up.
  - To learn how to integrate this feature, refer to the [setup tutorial](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/b4-live-activities/).
- Adds logic to re-synchronize Content Cards on SDK version changes.
- Adds provisional support for Xcode 14.3 Beta via the [`braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-xcode-14-3-preview`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-xcode-14-3-preview) repository.

- Fixes an issue where the release binaries could emit warnings when generating dSYMs.

##### Changed
- SwiftPM and CocoaPods now use the same release assets.

##### Added
- Adds support for the upcoming Braze Feature Flags product.
- Adds the `braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt.zip` archive to the release assets.
  - This archive contains the prebuilt xcframeworks and their associated resource bundles.
  - The content of this archive can be used to manually integrate the SDK.
- Adds the `Examples-Manual.xcodeproj` showcasing how to integrate the SDK using the prebuilt release assets.
- Adds support for Mac Catalyst for example applications, available at [Support/Examples/](./Support/Examples/README.md)
- Adds support to convert from `Data` into an in-app message, content card, or news feed card via `decoding(json:)`.

## 5.8.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes a conflict with the shared instance of [`ProcessInfo`], allowing low power mode notifications to trigger correctly.

##### Changed

## 5.8.0

To help migrate your app from the Appboy-iOS-SDK to our Swift SDK, this release includes the `Appboy-iOS-SDK` [migration guide]:
- Follow step-by-step instructions to migrate each feature to the new APIs.
- Includes instructions for a minimal migration scenario via our compatibility libraries.

##### Added
- Adds compatibility libraries `BrazeKitCompat` and `BrazeUICompat`:
  - Provides all the old APIs from `Appboy-iOS-SDK` to easily start migrating to the Swift SDK.
  - See the [migration guide] for more details.
- Adds support for [News Feed](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/news_feed) data models and analytics.
  - News Feed UI is not supported by the Swift SDK. See the [migration guide] for instructions on using the compatibility UI.

## 5.7.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where modal image in-app messages would not respect the aspect ratio of the image when the height of the image is larger than its width.

##### Changed
- Changes modal, modal image, full, and full image in-app message view attributes to use the `ViewDimension` type for their `minWidth`, `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` attributes.
  - The `ViewDimension` type enables providing different values for regular and large size-classes.

##### Added
- Adds a configuration to use a randomly generated UUID instead of IDFV as the device ID: [`useUUIDAsDeviceId`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/configuration-swift.class/useuuidasdeviceid).
  - This configuration defaults to `false`. To opt in to this feature, set this value to `true`.
  - Enabling this value will only affect new devices. Existing devices will use the device identifier that was previously registered.

## 5.6.4

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing the execution of `BrazeDelegate` methods when setting the delegate using Objective-C.
- Fixes an issue where triggering an in-app message twice with the same event did not place the message on the in-app message stack under certain conditions.

##### Added
- Adds the public `id` field to `Braze.InAppMessage.Data`.
- Adds `logImpression(using:)` and `logClick(buttonId:using:)` to both in-app messages and content cards, and adds `logDismissed(using:)` to content cards.
  - It is recommended to continue using the associated `Context` to log impressions, clicks, and dismissals for the majority of use cases.
- Adds Swift concurrency to support async/await versions of the following public methods. These methods can be used as alternatives to their corresponding counterparts that use completion handlers:
  - [`Braze.User.id()`]
  - [`Braze.deviceId()`]
  - [`ContentCards.requestRefresh()`]
  - [`ContentCards.cardsStream`] as an alternative to [`ContentCards.subscribeToUpdates(_:)`]
